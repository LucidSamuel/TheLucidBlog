## Body Language In Business

### If your goal is to be a good leader in the business world, you need to make sure your body language is also doing the talking.

Body language in business, as in life, is just as important as what you say.

Most times you may be saying one thing, but your body language could be interpreting something else entirely.

Body language is a non-negotiable deal when you have to deliver important presentations, pitch business ideas, or lead client meetings.

Projecting body confidence, and using certain gestures or facial expression, can do wonders to get your point across or let potential clients know you mean business. So I decided to write on a few tips on how you can get your body language to sync up with what you are really trying to say so as not to get people confused.

#### It’s all starts with the eye

Making eye contact with the people you are talking to or addressing shows interest. and this is because avoiding eye contact shows nervousness and a lack of self-esteem, but it can also be a very bad sign that you are lying about something. At the same time, giving too much eye contact could be interpreted as being over eager. Some people may even become uneasy by constant staring.

#### **Standing Tall**

Nothing tells people you lack confidence or are bored more than a slumped posture. To be taken seriously in the business world, you need to project the confidence of a leader. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and your shoulders squared.

To avoid slouching, keep your weight on the balls of your feet, as resting them on your heels could lead to bad posture. Standing tall also gives the illusion of power. It is also hard for people not to notice you!

#### Don’t look suspicious

I don’t mean like a criminal but like a liar. When pitching a business idea or sales pitch you don’t want to send the wrong message to clients.

Touching your face — and particularly your nose — is a key sign of deception. Faking a smile is another sign of someone untrustworthy, so don’t flash your pearly whites if you are not being very genuine.

#### Watch those arms

Crossing your arms while talking to someone is a major turn off. It could mean you are arrogant, uninterested, or being defensive. Putting your hands in your pocket or waving them all over the place is also not a good idea. It could mean you are either too confident, excited or a ball of nerves. Scratching the back of your head is also a major sign of uncertainty or doubt.

**Conclusion**

It might be a good idea to tape yourself giving a presentation to staff members or family and friends. This way you can watch yourself and your movements, and also get feedback from your audience on how they perceived you.
