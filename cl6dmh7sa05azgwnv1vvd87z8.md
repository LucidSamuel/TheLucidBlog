## The Future Of Technology Is Much More Than Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

While artificial intelligence and machine learning are grabbing most of the headlines for a while now, I will be writing about some technologies that will demand increased attention and Startups focusing on them for more productivity.

I decided to write on this Topic with intention of enlightening future Tech Entrepreneurs, software & hardware engineers and the Business tycoons on several other emerging technologies they can focus on besides AI & ML because I understand just following trends and not looking outside the box is the main reason most competitions, hackathons or startup event these days are mostly filled with the same notions or related ideas because they’re all focusing on this Giants (AI & ML).

### 1\. Deep learning

Even though **Deep learning** is a subset of machine **learning** in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of **learning** unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as **deep** neural **learning** or **deep neural network**.

According to *Brandon Purcell (*Principal Analyst at Forrester*)*

“Deep learning creates digital neural networks that mimic the interaction of neurons in the human brain. Today, these algorithms are used to detect objects in images, analyze sound waves to convert spoken speech to text or process natural human language into a structured format for analysis.”

So with this brief I can guess you already have a brief understanding of the Usefulness of Deep Learning in our society today, am not really going to be giving you ideas on ways to monetize this emerging technology but simply make you see the capabilities of this technology to be able to develop your ideas based on this great technology because of it’s usefulness all over the world will definitely be a key factor in generating revenue for your Startups.

### 2\. Natural Language Processing

Short for **natural language processing**, **NLP** deals with analyzing, **understanding** and generating the languages that humans use naturally in order to interface with computers in both written and spoken contexts using **natural** human languages instead of computer languages.

Well, this is basically not an emerging technology but a future in technology advancement all over the World, it has been in existence for a very long while and will still keep on having a great impact on the advance of the World in general when it comes to Technology. Today, many companies are investing in NLG to automate the creation of proposals, reports and other repeatable documents involving just text.

### 3\. Quantum computing

The wonderful thing about this technology is that it’s kind of a Startup on its own due to the fact that Quantum computers assure us of its ability to solve problems that digital computers have difficulty with or can’t solve. Which automatically means In the near future, they will be able to assist organizations in optimizing risk portfolios, setting appropriate prices to their product and services, building advanced machine learning applications and also discovering new materials and drugs. In my opinion, eventually, they may lead to a new field of cryptography, boost information search speeds, advance general AI, enable new disease treatments and help solve some of the world’s biggest problems.

The big question is in your ability to “own” or “control” this great technological advancement and be able to think of exceptional solutions based on it to develop your Ideas or Startup.

### 4\. Augmented, virtual and mixed reality

AR has actually found a home in industrial, manufacturing and field-service-oriented verticals; in the coming years, employees in healthcare, retail, and insurance will definitely also find these technologies becoming far more common. VR remains new for corporate training, but hazardous environments, medical clinics, and complex retail and logistics settings are using it. Expect horizontal growth in all verticals where corporate training is common but particularly in those involving physical activities. MR is gaining a foothold in architecture, industrial design, and engineering but will spread to healthcare, logistics and field service.

Even though this advancement has also been trending in the top list of Tech advancements the only problem is the fact that Startups have not really been playing their parts in using this technology to create the next big things or working on some of the biggest problems humans face till present.

### 5\. Computer vision

*The goal of computer vision is to extract useful information from images. This has proved a surprisingly challenging task; it has occupied thousands of intelligent and creative minds over the last four decades, and despite this, we are still far from being able to build a general-purpose “seeing machine.”*

Computer Vision, unlike other Tech advancements, is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.

So basically due to the increasing availability of cloud-based computer vision platforms from major vendors and startups alike, the retail, insurance, market research and security industries are now taking advantage of the insights in video feeds, marketing content and other image data sources. These apps can identify customers’ age and gender for content targeting; analyze facial expressions to comprehend human emotion, and identify suspicious actors to reduce security risks. And personally, I believe if this tech advancement is properly used it's going to be a factor in creating new ideas, innovations and redevelopment of many areas or problems around the world.
